Probability system


This is a simple example of a chart-based probability system for a roleplaying game that uses Tkinter to create a graphical user interface. It uses a tabbed interface to make it easy to navigate the game.


Requirements
Python 3
Tkinter library
Running the code
To run the code, navigate to the folder where the code is located in your command line or terminal and run the following command:


python ProbabilitySystem.py


How to use
The code creates a tabbed interface with a tab called "Player" that contains the probability system
The probability system has 4 buttons "Attack", "Defend", "Cast Spell" and "Use Skill"
When you click on one of the buttons, the code will use the probability from the chart and generate a random number to determine the outcome, which will be displayed in the label "Outcome"


Customizing the code
You can change the probabilities for each action in the self.probabilities dictionary
You can add or remove actions by modifying the create_gui method.
You can add more functionality to the system as desired.
You can add more tabs to the interface.


Conclusion
This code can be used as a starting point to create a simple chart-based probability system for a roleplaying game. It can also be used as an example to understand how to create a GUI using Python and Tkinter.
